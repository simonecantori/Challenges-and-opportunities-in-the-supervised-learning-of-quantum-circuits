# Title

This folder contains data from the article referenced above. The data are related to the extrapolation of the neural network on quantum circuits with 30 or more qubits, up to 60.
Both the angles of the quantum circuits and the predictions for the magnetization per qubit, as provided by the neural network, are included.

The loader.py file is used to load these data.

The quantum circuits have 30 layers of gates with different angles for each qubit but same angles for different layers.
